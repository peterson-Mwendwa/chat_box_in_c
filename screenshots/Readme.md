# 🤖 **ChatBot Project** 🗨️

### Coded by: **Valilian Peterson Mwendwa** 💻✨

Welcome to my **ChatBot** project! 🎉 This is a simple yet interactive chatbot designed to respond to user inputs with predefined messages. It’s coded in **C++** and is a fun way to demonstrate basic programming concepts like conditional statements, string manipulation, and loops. 🖥️

---

## 📜 **How It Works**

The **ChatBot** listens to your inputs and responds based on the predefined keywords. You can chat with it by typing commands, and it will greet you, tell you its name, show a help menu, or even say goodbye when you’re done. 💬

### 🛠️ **Key Features**:

- **Greeting**: Type "hello" and the ChatBot will greet you! 👋
- **Name**: Ask "name" to know about the bot! 🤖
- **Time**: Ask "time" to see if it knows the current time (still learning this! ⏰).
- **Goodbye**: Type "bye" to end the conversation. 👋
- **Help Menu**: Type "help" to display available commands. 💡
